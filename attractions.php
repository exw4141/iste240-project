                    <h2>Navy Pier</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        A very popular attraction of Chicago is Navy Pier in the Near North Side community area. It is 
                        essentially a hybrid of restaurants, shops, exhibitions, and venues combined into one area. What stands 
                        out at Navy Pier is the many different types of food you can eat there. There is Chicago deep dish pizza 
                        at Giordano's, seafood at Bubba Gump's (for Forrest Gump fans), and several dessert shops to try out 
                        after dinner. There is the common but delicious Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream but if you want something more 
                        exclusive to Chicago, there is FR√çO Gelato and their argentine gelato and sorbet desserts. Other interesting 
                        venues at Navy Pier include Crystal Gardens, an indoor botanical garden and Pier Park, a mini amusement park. 
                        During summers, there is a free fireworks show biweekly on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
