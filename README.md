This repository stores the code for my Web & Mobile II final project. It was previously available on a server only accessible on my university's wi-fi. Therefore, I decided to port it to Heroku for more widespread accessibility. Code was adapted for allowing the website to connect to a ClearDB Heroku add-on. Previously, this website interacted with a DB hosted by the class' department.
